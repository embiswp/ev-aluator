## Automated Test Suite Integration

### Contract Test Automation
Each API endpoint in contracts/ should have corresponding automated tests:
- `auth-api.yaml` → Authentication integration tests
- `upload-api.yaml` → File upload and processing tests
- `analysis-api.yaml` → EV analysis calculation tests

### Continuous Integration Requirements
1. All quickstart scenarios must pass before deployment
2. Performance benchmarks verified on each build
3. Security scan included in CI pipeline
4. Accessibility audit automated where possible

### Test Data Management
- Sample Google Takeout files of various sizes (1MB, 25MB, 80MB)
- Test data with different date ranges and transport modes
- Edge case datasets (no driving data, missing transport modes)
- Automated test data cleanup after test runs

This quickstart guide serves as both manual testing instructions and specification for automated test development.
