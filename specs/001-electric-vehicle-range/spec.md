# Feature Specification: Electric Vehicle Range Analyzer

**Feature Branch**: `001-electric-vehicle-range`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Electric Vehicle Range Analyzer - Product Specification"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user wants to determine if an electric vehicle with a specific range would meet their daily driving needs based on their historical Google location data. They log in, upload their location history file, specify an EV range, and receive analysis showing how many past days they drove within that range limit.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user has Google Takeout location history file, **When** they log in with Google OAuth and upload the file, **Then** system processes and validates the location data
2. **Given** location data is processed, **When** user specifies target EV range (e.g., 400km), **Then** system calculates and displays how many historical days had total driving distance within that range
3. **Given** user has completed analysis, **When** they choose to delete data, **Then** system removes all location data and allows new file upload
4. **Given** user completes session, **When** they log out, **Then** system automatically deletes all uploaded location data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploaded file is corrupted or invalid JSON format?
- How does system handle location data with missing transport mode information?
- What occurs if user uploads file exceeding 100MB size limit?
- How does system respond when location data contains no motorized vehicle trips?
- What happens if user specifies unrealistic EV range values (negative, extremely large)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users via Google OAuth integration
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept Google Takeout location history JSON file uploads up to 100MB
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate uploaded files are properly formatted JSON location data
- **FR-004**: System MUST parse location history and identify motorized vehicle trips (car, bus, motorbike)
- **FR-005**: System MUST exclude non-motorized transport modes (walking, running, cycling, train, air travel)
- **FR-006**: System MUST calculate daily total kilometers driven for each day in the dataset
- **FR-007**: System MUST accept user-specified EV range input in kilometers
- **FR-008**: System MUST analyze historical data to determine days where total driving was within specified EV range
- **FR-009**: System MUST display results showing number of compatible days vs total driving days
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide manual data deletion option during user session
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically delete all user data upon logout
- **FR-012**: System MUST store uploaded data temporarily only during active user session
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide file upload validation with clear error messages for invalid files
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle multiple file uploads by replacing previous data after user confirmation

### Key Entities
- **User Session**: Authenticated user state with temporary data storage, linked to Google OAuth identity
- **Location History Data**: Parsed Google Takeout JSON containing timestamped location points with transport modes
- **Daily Trip Summary**: Aggregated daily driving distances calculated from motorized vehicle trips only  
- **EV Range Analysis**: Comparison results showing historical day compatibility with specified electric vehicle range
- **Transport Mode Classification**: Categorization system distinguishing motorized (car, bus, motorbike) from non-motorized activities
